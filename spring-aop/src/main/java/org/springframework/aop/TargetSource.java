 * advice chooses to end the interceptor chain itself.

 * <p>If a {@code TargetSource} is "static", it will always return
 * the same target, allowing optimizations in the AOP framework. Dynamic
 * target sources can support pooling, hot swapping, etc.
 *
 * <p>Application developers don't usually need to work with
 * {@code TargetSources} directly: this is an AOP framework interface.
